# GitHub Repository "About" Section Enhancement

## Current Description
"Production-grade probabilistic identity resolution system for streaming platforms"

## Recommended Enhanced Description (157 characters - fits GitHub limit)

**Option 1 - Technical Focus:**
```
Probabilistic identity resolution for streaming platforms. 81.4% accuracy, 104ms latency, 12M events/hr. Production-ready with GDPR compliance.
```

**Option 2 - Problem/Solution Focus:**
```
Solves the "Netflix co-viewing problem" - distinguishes individual viewers in shared accounts for person-level attribution. 22% lift over baseline.
```

**Option 3 - Comprehensive (if GitHub allows longer):**
```
Production-grade identity resolution system for streaming platforms. Distinguishes individual viewers in shared accounts using behavioral fingerprinting. 81.4% person assignment accuracy, 104ms inference latency, validated at 12M events/hour. GDPR/CCPA compliant with cryptographic deletion pipelines. 2,320 lines of production Python with comprehensive test coverage.
```
